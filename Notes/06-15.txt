Notes (States)

AL:

As noted yesterday, the data now includes both probable cases and deaths. Because of this, 
there are 380 additional cases and 5 additional deaths reported in the published data today. 
A breakdown is available in the notes/supplements folder in the repo here:

TX:

On June 8th, Brazoria County, TX removed inmate numbers from there overall case counts, causing
a significant decrease in cases. This is reported on the official county Facebook page here: 
https://www.facebook.com/BrazoriaCo/ 

By examining the reporting on the Facebook page, it appears that on June 8th, 267 inmates were
removed from the county's tabulation -- the county reported 22 new cases on 06/07, and the overall total decreased 
from what would have been 1025 to 758 [1025 - 758 = 267]. 

The numbers published from June 8th onwards 
[https://www.brazoriacountytx.gov/departments/health-department/brazoria-county-coronavirus-map]
should then include an additional 267 cases. Brazoria County additionally provides line item
case details with case IDs. At this point in time the number of cases in the county can be 
represented by the largest case ID reported on the county website (case IDs normally incremented 
by 1 and were not reused when inmates were taken out of the reporting).

Inmate numbers are shown because it is unclear from the TX Dept of Criminal Justice 
[https://www.tdcj.texas.gov/covid-19/definitions.html]
if those numbers are being incorporated in the overall state numbers at all. Additionally, the data
from the TX Dept of Criminal Justice is not reliable because as noted on their site: 

Positive cases are "may include multiple positive cases per person, if the person was tested more 
than once." This is more appropriately interpreted as "Positive Tests." It's possible that 
Active Cases + Recovered Cases is reflective of the total cumulative confirmed cases in the TX 
DOC, but we are not comfortable making that assessment at this time.


OR:

There were 99 new cases in Union County, OR, which represents an abnormal spike. This is attributable
to a local outbreak. From the state: "OHA is coordinating with Union County public health authorities 
to respond to an outbreak of COVID-19. The outbreak explains the high number of cases today in Union County"

KS:

Crawford County, KS showed an abnormal spike from 18 to 96 cases.

NM:

Hidalgo County, NM reported an increase from 3 to 20 cases.

MO:

MO did not update their dashboard on 06/14, but published statewide totals on their health website. These were all placed
in Statewide Unallocated. This is not an issue in the 06/15 data.
