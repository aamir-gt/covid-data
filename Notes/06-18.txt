Notes (States):

LA:

Louisiana has indicated they will not be updating data for 06/18 due to technical reasons. Historically,
This has meant that they will also not break out new cases and deaths on 06/19 into two separate
dates, and we might expect to see a larger increase in 06/19 as a result.

MS:

The state has experienced technical issues, and historically we have been able to backfill and
reconcile thee issues in MS.

ND:

For unknown reasons, the state has not updated data. The state health department website has no 
indication that 06/18 has been published, it is likely that the update is delayed for some reason.
The state generally provides an ability to see trend data, and this will likely be possible to
backfill.
