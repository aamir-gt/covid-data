Notes (States)

TX:

The state began including cases from inmates once again. The dataset is preferring the state health department 
website for counties with significant inmate populations. 

Anderson County, TX had an increase of 800+ cases due to the incorporation of inmate numbers -- this will appear
as an abnormally large spike, but the TX health department specifically points to the change in reporting from
TX Department of Corrections.

KS:

Only updates MWF.

RI:

It's likely that revision is necessary for the past few dates in deaths. RI occasionally updates its town and 
county numbers for both cases and deaths, and it appears that the dataset might be missing updates at
that level of granularity.

DC:

The dataset reports data one day in front of the DC government (i.e., June 15th data is reported under June 16th).
