Notes:

General:

There was a smaller than expected increase in deaths, but this is not uncommon on Sunday data uploads. In general,
we see a higher than normal uptick on Mondays that compensates for this.

DC, ND, VA, WV:

Data on 06/21 was erroneously reported for 06/20 -- corrected in the new dataset

KS:

Numbers updated in some larger counties, but the rest of the state updates MWF. Data for larger counties sourced
from the counties themselves.

LA:

If possible, data will be backfilled and corrected as a result of the state's removal of case duplications. At the
moment this might cause trends to look odd in certain counties whose data was particularly affected by the removal
of duplicated cases.
